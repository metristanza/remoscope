### Activity Summary

| Account | Posts | Followers | Last Active | Status |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **@WeGoLook** | 8,828 | 3,877 | Aug 2020 | 💀 DEAD — no posts in 5+ years |
| **@ProxyPics** ✓ | 1,651 | 831 | Daily | 🟡 Active but low engagement (5-13 views) |
| **@ivueitapp** | 1,444 | 776 | Daily | 🟡 Active but low engagement (3-28 views) |

### What They Post (and Why It Fails)

**WeGoLook (@WeGoLook):**
- Completely abandoned since Aug 2020
- Last posts were corporate reposts from parent Crawford
- No community engagement, no thought leadership
- 💡 Opportunity: Insurance vertical is WIDE OPEN on X

**ProxyPics (@ProxyPics):**
- Daily posts but ZERO engagement
- Content: "ProxyPets" (photos of pets), support shoutouts, hashtag spam
- Not talking TO customers, talking AT them
- Generic corporate voice, no personality
- 💡 Opportunity: Beat them by being human and conversational

**iVueit (@ivueitapp):**
- Regular posts, slightly better engagement (up to 28 views)
- Content: App update announcements, "Vuer" appreciation posts
- Heavy on hashtags (#iVueit #VueMoreDoMore)
- Still mostly talking to themselves
- 💡 Opportunity: They're not engaging with their target market at all

### Key Insights

1. **None of them are doing DM outreach** — they're just broadcasting
2. **No thought leadership** — nobody positioning as the expert
3. **No engagement with target customers** — not joining relevant conversations
4. **WeGoLook abandoned X entirely** — Crawford doesn't care about social
5. **All have weak follower counts** for their company size

## 🎯 Remoscope's X Strategy

### Differentiation Tactics

1. **Be conversational, not corporate** — No hashtag spam, no "we're pleased to announce"
2. **Engage first, pitch later** — Reply to target accounts' posts before DMing
3. **Join existing conversations** — Comment on threads about remote work, property management, insurance
4. **Share insights, not promotions** — "Here's what I learned talking to cleaning business owners..."
5. **Ask questions publicly** — Creates engagement and positions you as curious/learning

### Content Mix (3-2-1 Rule)

For every 6 posts:
- **3 engagement posts** — Replies to others, quote tweets with commentary
- **2 insight posts** — Observations about remote work verification, industry problems
- **1 soft pitch** — What you're building, waitlist, etc.

### Voice/Tone

- First person ("I" not "We")
- Curious and learning, not expert lecturing
- Acknowledge the problem is real
- Don't pretend the product is done — "building," "early access," "testing"

## Priority DM Targets

### Tier 1 — High Priority (Cleaning/Remote Services)
| Handle | Who | Why Target |
|--------|-----|------------|
| @SqueegeeGod | Johnny Robinson | Remote cleaning, 800+ students in his course |
| @cleanwithmike | Mike Cleans | $40k/mo remote cleaning business |
| @ianncushing | Ian Cushing | Coaches remote cleaning business launches |
| @JennTendero | Jenn Tendero | Wrote playbook for remote home services |

### Tier 2 — Real Estate Investors
| Handle | Who | Why Target |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Search BiggerPockets community | Out-of-state investors | Active niche, clear pain point |
| @biggerpockets | BP Official | Engage with their content to reach audience |

### Tier 3 — Insurance (Underserved)
- Search for claims adjusters venting about backlogs
- Independent agencies, not corporate (they're more nimble)
- Note: WeGoLook abandoned this space on X — it's yours

## Outreach Templates

### Template 1 — For Remote Business Operators
> Hey! Saw you're running [local service type] remotely — quick question: how do you verify the work is actually done right when you're not there? 
>
> Working on something that might solve that. Would love to hear how you handle it today.

### Template 2 — For Lead Gen Agencies
> Running local ads for contractors is one thing — but do you ever worry about the quality of work your leads turn into?
>
> Building a service where verified local agents do live video inspections of completed jobs. Think it'd be useful for agencies like yours?

### Template 3 — For Real Estate Investors
> Investing out of state? Curious — how do you evaluate properties before flying out? Listing photos only tell half the story.
>
> Working on live video walkthroughs from local agents. You'd basically have someone walk the property and neighborhood while you watch from your laptop. Interesting?

### Template 4 — For Insurance People
> How long does it typically take to get an adjuster to a claim site? Hearing a lot about backlogs.
>
> We're building a way to get live video verification from any location same-day — verified local agents on the ground. Think that would speed things up for your team?

### Template 5 — For News / Media
> Curious — when a story breaks in a city where you don't have a crew, how fast can you get footage?
>
> Working on a verified agent network that can stream live from any scene in minutes. Like on-demand stringers. Would that be useful for your newsroom?

### Template 6 — Generic / Entrepreneurs
> Quick question — if you could have someone go to any location and stream live video to you within hours, what would you use it for?
>
> Building exactly that. Trying to figure out which use cases matter most. Would love your take.

## Approach

### Do's
- **Lead with curiosity**, not a sales pitch — ask about their problem first
- **Be genuine** — you're validating, not selling vaporware
- **Engage with their content first** — like/reply to a few posts before DMing
- **Keep it short** — 2-3 sentences max for first touch
- **Follow up once** if no reply after 3-4 days
- **Monitor competitor accounts** — Reply to people who engage with @ProxyPics or @ivueitapp

### Don'ts
- Don't spam — max 10-15 outreach DMs per day to avoid account flags
- Don't copy-paste identical messages (X detects this)
- Don't pitch immediately — have a conversation first
- Don't lie about product readiness — say "building" or "early access"
- Don't use hashtag spam like competitors do

### Tracking
Keep a simple spreadsheet:
| Date | Handle | Vertical | Message Sent | Response? | Interested? | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| | | | | | | |

## Competitive Advantage on X

### Why Remoscope Can Win

1. **WeGoLook is asleep** — Nobody home for 5 years. Insurance audience is uncontested.

2. **ProxyPics talks to themselves** — 831 followers, zero engagement. You can pass them in weeks with actual conversations.

3. **iVueit is generic** — Corporate hashtag spam. Easy to beat with authentic voice.

4. **Live video is a new category** — None of them can claim it. You own this narrative.

5. **SMB focus is underserved** — All competitors chase enterprise. Small operators are on X and eager to talk.

### Weekly Action Plan

**Week 1-2: Warm Up**
- Post 3 warm-up posts (problem-focused, no pitch)
- Like/reply to 20+ posts from target accounts
- Join 5+ conversations about remote work verification

**Week 3-4: Outreach**
- Start DM outreach (10-15/day max)
- Continue engagement (don't go silent)
- Track responses in spreadsheet

**Week 5+: Scale What Works**
- Double down on verticals that respond
- Share learnings publicly ("Talked to 50 cleaning biz owners, here's what I learned...")
- Build authority through insights

## Quick Wins — Accounts to Engage With

Search for and engage with people posting about:
1. **"Scaling a cleaning business"** — huge remote operations community on X
2. **"Out of state real estate investing"** — very active niche
3. **"Local SEO / lead gen agency"** — tons of agency owners sharing their process
4. **"Insurance claims" + frustration** — adjusters venting about backlogs
5. **"Local news dying"** — journalists discussing coverage gaps

These people ARE your market. Start conversations, not sales pitches.
