## Outreach Templates

### Template 1 — For Remote Business Operators
> Hey! Saw you're running [local service type] remotely — quick question: how do you verify the work is actually done right when you're not there? 
>
> Working on something that might solve that. Would love to hear how you handle it today.

### Template 2 — For Lead Gen Agencies
> Running local ads for contractors is one thing — but do you ever worry about the quality of work your leads turn into?
>
> Building a service where verified local agents do live video inspections of completed jobs. Think it'd be useful for agencies like yours?

### Template 3 — For Real Estate Investors
> Investing out of state? Curious — how do you evaluate properties before flying out? Listing photos only tell half the story.
>
> Working on live video walkthroughs from local agents. You'd basically have someone walk the property and neighborhood while you watch from your laptop. Interesting?

### Template 4 — For Insurance People
> How long does it typically take to get an adjuster to a claim site? Hearing a lot about backlogs.
>
> We're building a way to get live video verification from any location same-day — verified local agents on the ground. Think that would speed things up for your team?

### Template 5 — For News / Media
> Curious — when a story breaks in a city where you don't have a crew, how fast can you get footage?
>
> Working on a verified agent network that can stream live from any scene in minutes. Like on-demand stringers. Would that be useful for your newsroom?

### Template 6 — Generic / Entrepreneurs
> Quick question — if you could have someone go to any location and stream live video to you within hours, what would you use it for?
>
> Building exactly that. Trying to figure out which use cases matter most. Would love your take.

## Approach

### Do's
- **Lead with curiosity**, not a sales pitch — ask about their problem first
- **Be genuine** — you're validating, not selling vaporware
- **Engage with their content first** — like/reply to a few posts before DMing
- **Keep it short** — 2-3 sentences max for first touch
- **Follow up once** if no reply after 3-4 days

### Don'ts
- Don't spam — max 10-15 outreach DMs per day to avoid account flags
- Don't copy-paste identical messages (X detects this)
- Don't pitch immediately — have a conversation first
- Don't lie about product readiness — say "building" or "early access"

### Tracking
Keep a simple spreadsheet:
| Date | Handle | Vertical | Message Sent | Response? | Interested? | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| | | | | | | |

## Quick Wins — Accounts to Engage With

Search for and engage with people posting about:
1. **"Scaling a cleaning business"** — huge remote operations community on X
2. **"Out of state real estate investing"** — very active niche
3. **"Local SEO / lead gen agency"** — tons of agency owners sharing their process
4. **"Insurance claims" + frustration** — adjusters venting about backlogs
5. **"Local news dying"** — journalists discussing coverage gaps

These people ARE your market. Start conversations, not sales pitches.
