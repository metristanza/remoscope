# Remoscope — Meta Ads: Testing LIVE Video Demand

**Objective:** Validate if "LIVE video" specifically drives interest, or if generic "remote verification" is enough.

---

## 🧪 A/B TEST STRUCTURE

Run both versions. Compare CTR and signup rates.

- **Version A:** Generic remote verification (control)
- **Version B:** LIVE video specific (test hypothesis)

If Version B wins → LIVE is the differentiator
If Version A wins → People want any remote verification

## VERIFICATION VERTICAL

### VERSION A: Generic (Control)
**remoscope.com/verification**

**Primary text:**
Running a cleaning business remotely?

You assign the jobs. Someone else does the work. But you never see it.

Remoscope sends verified agents to inspect completed work and report back. Know the job was done right — without being there.

Quality control for remote operations.

**Headline:** Verify Remote Work Without Being There
**Description:** Verified agents inspect local jobs. Quality assurance at scale.
**CTA:** Sign Up

### VERSION B: LIVE Specific (Test)
**remoscope.com/verification**

**Primary text:**
Photos arrive hours later.

Hand-picked angles. Best lighting. No way to see what they didn't show you.

What if you could WATCH it yourself — live?

Remoscope streams real-time video from the job site. You control the camera.

"Show me behind the couch."
"Check under the sink."
"What's that spot?"

Not a report. A live video call with eyes on the ground.

**Headline:** Watch the Work LIVE — Not in Photos Later
**Description:** Real-time video. You direct the camera. See everything.
**CTA:** Sign Up

## INSURANCE VERTICAL

### VERSION A: Generic (Control)
**remoscope.com/insurance**

**Primary text:**
Can't send an adjuster to every claim site?

Remoscope dispatches verified local agents to assess damage and report back. Same-day verification. Geotagged, timestamped documentation.

Faster claims. Lower field costs.

**Headline:** Verify Claims Without Sending an Adjuster
**Description:** Same-day damage assessment from verified local agents.

### VERSION B: LIVE Specific (Test)
**remoscope.com/insurance**

**Primary text:**
Your adjuster sends 12 photos.

You have 12 questions.

"What's behind that panel?"
"How far does the damage extend?"
"Is that water or just shadow?"

Now you wait. Again.

What if you could just ASK — live?

Remoscope streams real-time video from the claim site. Direct the agent. Ask questions. Get answers on the spot.

**Headline:** See Claims LIVE — Ask Questions in Real-Time
**Description:** Live video. Two-way audio. Instant answers.
